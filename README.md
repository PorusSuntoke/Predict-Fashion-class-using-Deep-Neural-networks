# Predict-Fashion-class-using-Deep-Neural-networks
Fashion dataset consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28 * 28 grayscale image, associated with a label
from 10 classes. In this model we developed a Convolution Neural Network model. Using the dataset we evaluated the model and achieved an accuracy of 92%. I have done this project in two different frameworks, TensorFlow and Pytorch.
